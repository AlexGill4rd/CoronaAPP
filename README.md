# CoronaAPP
I made the app to easily see the corona figures of my country. 
The program uses an API that retrieves the data live from the server. 
He then reads this in and then processes it. In this way, the user can select the country he wishes to study in the GUI. 
Here the user can observe the data of the country.

## Is this under development?
No, the development of this program has ended because I have achieved what I wanted to achieve with this program.

## Can I use the code?
You can use whatever you want from this program. If this helps you I only think it's good.
